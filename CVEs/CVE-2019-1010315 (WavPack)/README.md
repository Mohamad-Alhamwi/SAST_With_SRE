# CVE-2019-1010315 (WavPack)

## Installing The Vulnerable Version

1. We clone the repository:

```C
git clone https://github.com/dbry/WavPack.git WavPack
```

2. We navigate into the project directory:

```C
cd WavPack
```

3. We find the commit related to the vulnerability (using the first 7 characters of the commit ID provided above). I would like to view the 5 lines before and after the concerned commit for better context:

```C
git log --graph --oneline --all | grep -B 5 -A 5 "4c0faba"
```

Now, we should see the commit `4c0faba` for **CVE-2019-1010315**.

4. We `checkout` the commit before the patch to retrieve the vulnerable version. Note that we `checkout` the `8948be9` commit, not the `f68a955` commit, because the git graph is read vertically from bottom to top:

```C
git checkout 8948be9
```

Eventually, we have the vulnerable version of **WavPack** before the fix for **CVE-2019-1010315** was applied. Now, we are ready to dive in.
