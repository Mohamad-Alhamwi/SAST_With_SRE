# CVE-2017-1000249 (The file utility)

## Installing The Vulnerable Version

1.  We clone the repository:

```C
git clone https://github.com/file/file.git File
```

2.  We navigate into the project directory:

```C
cd File
```

3.  Since we know the commit that introduced the **CVE-2017-1000249** vulnerability, we can directly `checkout` into the state of the repository at that commit.

```C
git checkout 9611f31313a93aa036389c5f3b15eea53510d4d1
```

Eventually, we have the vulnerable version of **OpenCV** before the fix for **CVE-2017-1000249** was applied. Now, we are ready to dive in.
