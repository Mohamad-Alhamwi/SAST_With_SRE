# CVE-2019-19334 (Libyang)

## Installing The Vulnerable Version

1. We clone the repository:

```C
git clone https://github.com/CESNET/libyang.git Libyang
```

2. We navigate into the project directory:

```C
cd Libyang
```

3. We find the commit related to the vulnerability (using the first 7 characters of the commit ID provided above). I would like to view the 5 lines before and after the concerned commit for better context:

```C
git log --graph --oneline --all | grep -B 5 -A 5 "6980afa"
```

Now, we should see the commit `6980afa` for **CVE-2019-19334**.

4. We `checkout` the commit before the patch to retrieve the vulnerable version. Note that we `checkout` the `f6d684ade` commit, not the `803710171` commit, because the git graph is read vertically from bottom to top:

```C
git checkout f6d684ade
```

Eventually, we have the vulnerable version of **Libyang** before the fix for **CVE-2019-19334** was applied. Now, we are ready to dive in.
