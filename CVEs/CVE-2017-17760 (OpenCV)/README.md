# CVE-2017-17760 (OpenCV)

## Installing The Vulnerable Version

1.  We clone the repository:

```C
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git OpenCV
```

2.  We navigate into the project directory:

```C
cd OpenCV/
```

3.  We find the commit related to the vulnerability (using the first 7 characters of the commit ID provided above). I would like to view the 5 lines before and after the concerned commit for better context:

```C
git log --graph --oneline --all | grep -B 5 -A 5 "7bbe1a5"
```

Now, we should see the commit \`7bbe1a53cf\` for **CVE-2017-17760**.

4.  We `checkout` the commit before the patch to retrieve the vulnerable version. Note that we `checkout` the `a2620f72c7` commit, not the \`70d49446e9\` commit, because the git graph is read vertically from bottom to top:

```C
git checkout a2620f72c7
```

Eventually, we have the vulnerable version of **OpenCV** before the fix for **CVE-2017-17760** was applied. Now, we are ready to dive in.
