# BUG-2018 (Wireshark)

I have not encountered any officially assigned CVE identifier for this bug. It exists at the same point where the vulnerability **CVE-2018-11360** was present, according to the original research repository [SAST_on_Decompilers](https://github.com/elManto/SAST_on_Decompilers/tree/main/CVE/BUG-2018-wireshark2) . So no need to install the Wireshark project files again. Refer to the project files at `/CVEs/CVE-2018-11360 (Wireshark)/Wireshark/`.
